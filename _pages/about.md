# Short Bio
I am currently a lecturer at College of Systems Engineering, [National University of Defense Technology](https://english.nudt.edu.cn/) (NUDT), China, where I obtained my PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. Jiuyang Tang and [Prof. Xiang Zhao](https://xiangz-nudt.github.io/) in 2022, and the Bachelor's Degree in 2017. 

My research interests include: Knowledge Graphs, and Data Management.
